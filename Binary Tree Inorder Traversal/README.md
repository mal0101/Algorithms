# Explanation of Inorder Traversal Algorithm
The algorithm performs an inorder traversal of a binary tree, which means it visits each node in a specific order: left subtree, root, right subtree. This traversal order is especially useful for binary search trees because it results in values being accessed in ascending order.

## How Inorder Traversal Works
In a binary tree, each node has:

A left child (another subtree or None).
A value (the data contained in the node).
A right child (another subtree or None).
For each node:

Traverse the left subtree by going as far left as possible before visiting any nodes. This is why the algorithm pushes nodes onto a stack in the iterative version or uses recursion to "hold" nodes until their left subtrees are fully processed.

Visit the root node of the current subtree. This means adding the node's value to the result list.

Traverse the right subtree by moving to the right child node, repeating the left-root-right process from that node.

## What the Algorithm Achieves
Sorted Output (for BSTs): If the tree is a binary search tree (BST), this traversal will yield the values in sorted, ascending order.
Complete Visit of Nodes: It ensures that every node is visited exactly once.
Structured Order of Nodes: In non-BSTs, it still produces a specific order of values based on their positions in the tree, useful in contexts where hierarchical relationships matter.
