# Binary Search Algorithm

The binary search algorithm is a method for finding a target value within a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It’s very efficient, with a time complexity of 𝑂(log(𝑛)); which means it’s much faster than a linear search for large datasets.

This figured in the "Search Insert Position" Problem on Leetcode.

## Sqrt(x):
Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.
