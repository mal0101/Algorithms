# Binary Search Algorithm

The binary search algorithm is a method for finding a target value within a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It’s very efficient, with a time complexity of 𝑂(log(𝑛)); which means it’s much faster than a linear search for large datasets.

This figured in the "Search Insert Position" Problem on Leetcode.
